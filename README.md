# CodeAlpha_AgeCalculator

## TASK 1: AGE CALCULATOR

### Objective:
Created a web-based **Age Calculator** using JavaScript that takes the user's **Date of Birth** and calculates their exact age (in years, months, and days).

### Features:
- **User Input**: The user provides their date of birth (day, month, year) via an input form.
- **Age Calculation**: The system calculates and displays the current age based on the provided birthdate, including:
  - Years
  - Months
  - Days
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that all fields are filled and the date is valid before calculating.

### Tech Stack Used:
- **HTML**: To create the input form and display the results.
- **CSS**: For styling the webpage to make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: To handle the age calculation logic using the `Date` object and DOM manipulation.

### Key Concepts:
- **DOM Manipulation**: Used to interact with the HTML elements for getting input and displaying the result.
- **Working with JavaScript Date & Time**: Utilized the `Date` object to calculate age based on the user's birthdate.
- **Input Validation**: Ensured that the user inputs are valid (e.g., no empty fields or invalid dates).

### How It Works:
1. The user enters their **Day**, **Month**, and **Year** of birth in the input fields.
2. Upon clicking the "Calculate" button:
   - The date is validated to ensure all fields are filled and the birthdate is correct.
   - The age is calculated in terms of **years**, **months**, and **days**.
3. The result is displayed on the screen.
